# Skill Scheme
Skill Scheme is a class-builder PvP addon for Minecraft. 
The plugin attempts improve combat by introducing dozens of new skills.
These skills can be combined in one of five unique classes.

Although many skills come baked into the plugin, the plugin itself is 
fundamentally a skills *engine*. Much effort has been expended in making sure
it is easy to add, balance, and remove skills.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for Skill Scheme comes from [Minplex Champions](https://www.mineplex.com/games/champions/).
